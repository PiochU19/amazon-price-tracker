## Short description

App is using Python built in **requests** and *BeautifulSoup* from **bs4** to scrap Amazon Site. User can set the price, choose product from list taken from Amazon and set the 'Tracker'.

Celery has a periodic task (executes everyday on midnight), which checks if actual product price is less than price provided by user. If True, alert is sending through email and Tracker is deleted.

## Todo
* Ability to change prices
* Better responsivity
* Add more Online Shops (not only Amazon)
